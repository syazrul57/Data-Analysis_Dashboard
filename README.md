# Road-Accident-Data-Analysis (Interaction Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
## Project Objective
Clients wants to create a Road Accident Dashboard for year 2021 and 2022 so that they can have insight on the casualities of the accident from 2021 to 2022.

## Dataset Used
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R_uaoZL18nRbqC_MULVne90h3SdRbAyn/edit?gid=1319047066#gid=1319047066">Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
* Primary KPI - Total Casualties taken place after the accident
* Primary KPI's - Total Casualties & percentage of total with respect to accident severity and maximum casualties by type of vehicle
* Secondary KPI's - Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type
* Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for Current Year and Previous Year
* Maximum casualties by Road Type
* Distribution of total casualties by Road Surface
* Relation between Casualties by Area/ Location & by Day/ Night

- Dashboard Interaction <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z6HdImodlHgZe9Npx_VAOLBC4MnqeaTF/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110026729226337791150&rtpof=true&sd=true">View Dashboard</a>

## Process
* Verify data for any missing values anomalies, and sort out the same.
* Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
* Create pivot tables according to the questions asked.
* Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dynamic.

# Data-Analysis_Dashboard
I developed a comprehensive project in Excel, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization.

## Project Insight
### Casualties by Road Type
* Single carriageways are the most dangerous, contributing to 309.7K casualties, far higher than dual carriageways (67.4K) and roundabouts (26.8K).

### Vehicle Type Involvement
* Cars account for the vast majority of casualties (333,485, or ~80%), followed by motorcycles (33,672) and vans (33,472).

### Time & Light Conditions
* Most accidents occurred during daylight hours (305K), nearly 3x more than at night (112.9K), likely due to heavier traffic during the day.

### Road Surface
* The majority of casualties occurred on dry roads (279,445), showing that poor weather isn't the primary factor â€” suggesting human error or traffic behavior is more significant.

### Location
* Urban areas recorded the most casualties (255.9K) compared to rural (162.0K), aligning with higher traffic volumes and population density in urban environments.

### Fatality Rate
* Fatal casualties make up only 1.7% (7,135) of total cases, indicating that while accidents are frequent, most are non-fatal but still serious.

## Final Conclusion
* The dashboard highlights that most road accident casualties occur on single carriageways, during daylight, in urban areas, and involve cars. Despite good road conditions (dry surfaces), accidents remain high, pointing to driver behavior, traffic volume, and infrastructure as major contributing factors. The upward trend in monthly casualties compared to previous years signals a need for urgent road safety initiatives, including awareness campaigns, improved road design, and stricter enforcement in high-risk zones.
