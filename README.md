# Road-Accident-Data-Analysis (Interaction Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
## Project Objective
Clients wants to create a Road Accident Dashboard for year 2021 and 2022 so that they can have insight on the casualities of the accident from 2021 to 2022.

## Dataset Used
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R_uaoZL18nRbqC_MULVne90h3SdRbAyn/edit?gid=1319047066#gid=1319047066">Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
* Primary KPI - Total Casualties taken place after the accident
* Primary KPI's - Total Casualties & percentage of total with respect to accident severity and maximum casualties by type of vehicle
* Secondary KPI's - Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type
* Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for Current Year and Previous Year
* Maximum casualties by Road Type
* Distribution of total casualties by Road Surface
* Relation between Casualties by Area/ Location & by Day/ Night

## Process
* Verify data for any missing values anomalies, and sort out the same.
* Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
* Create pivot tables according to the questions asked.
* Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dynamic.

# Data-Analysis_Dashboard
I developed a comprehensive project in Excel, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization.

* The majority of accidents occurred on single carriageways (309.7K), suggesting these roads may lack adequate safety features or enforcement.
* Cars were involved in the most accidents (333,485), potentially due to their high usage and traffic density.
* Daylight accidents (305K) were nearly 3x higher than those at night (112.9K), indicating traffic volume or daytime distractions may be a factor.
